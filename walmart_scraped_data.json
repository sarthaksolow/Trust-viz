You could easily spend a couple of hours at a time playing Astro's Playroom. I highly recommend buying the PS5 disc edition.",

These holes expose nearby wording which identify the contents as a PlayStation. Luckily, mine was not stolen, but I was also home to receive it. \n\nFurthermore, either my courier thought the holes made great handles or the holes allowed the package to become snagged on something. Either way, not only was the shipping box torn open, but this also completely ripped up the bottom of the PS5 packaging.\n\nI've never made a stink before, no matter how poor the packaging. However, when I spend $550 on a single item, I expect it to arrive protected....or, at the very least, in a box with all its sides. It's just common sense.",

He has only used it one day and when he went to put a disc in to play the disc drive sounded like it was a weedwacker/trimmer that you use outside to work on lawns. It was so loud. My husband and I tried multiple disc and it made that noise every time. After about 10 minutes or so it would stop but after some time it would start back up again. He had a disc in while he downloaded content for it and was playing a digital game and after about an hour playing the digital game the consoles drive started getting really loud again. We didn‚Äôt figured it was cause the disc was still in there downloading content, but all of a sudden the disc came flinging out of the console. I‚Äôm very mad about the fact that I‚Äôm paying over a $1,000 to Walmart for a console that was supposed to be brand new and it doesn‚Äôt even work right before we even get to use it. Now I‚Äôm probably going to have to call Sony and see if they will either fix it or replace it. There‚Äôs no point in having a disc version of a console when the console won‚Äôt even keep your games in it, and 90% of your games are on disc. Very disappointed and honestly don‚Äôt know how I feel about ever buying another console or video game system from Walmart again.",

The basket holds a good amount of ice and per the instruction the chute does need to be cleared by redistributing the ice,  if you want more ice to be made. I use it several times a day so it is not a problem for me.  I use RO water but still have used the cleaning mode, which I like as my bullet ones didn't have this feature. This was actually half price and so far it has been great. The picture still shows the protective film that I have yet to remove.",

        "text": "This is my second icemaker. The 1st one lasted almost 2 years, just 1 week shy of the extended warranty plan's expiration date. That almost never happens. I got lucky.\n\nThis one is better: I like the visible ice basket so I  don't have to open the lid to see the amount of ice. It has a suction cup to hang the scoop. It is faster at making ice. It's prettier. The ice falls from the center, so it doesn't seem to think it's full as fast as the one that filled from the side.\nI know most machines are made by the same company but with different features and the same short life spans, usually 1 to 2 years. Always get the extended warranty on items like this. \n\nI got this one for $25  less than on Amazon and the 3 year Allstate plan for less than 1/2 the price of 2 year Asurion plan. Win! \n\n I had really wanted a Smart ice maker this time, but I found with my 1st machine that using a Switchbot made setting a timer much cheaper, and it's Google Home Compatible. \n\nClean regularly to make it last, esp with hard water. 5 to 1 water/vinegar.  I just started using descaling tablets or liquid to make this one last longer. Use filtered, spring, or distilled water if possible. \nTake the top off the machine to check for mold or scale every month, or if you see any specks in the water. \nEnjoy your clean Sonic ice!",

        "title": "A Journey in a Bottle",
        "text": "From the moment I first encountered Giorgio Armani's My Way Eau de Parfum, I knew it was more than just a fragrance‚Äîit felt like an invitation to journey inward, to explore facets of myself I hadn't yet discovered. With each spritz, I'm transported to a world of elegance and wonder, where every note seems to tell its own unique story.\n\nThe opening is fresh and bright, with bergamot and orange blossom swirling around me like a crisp breeze on a warm day. It feels as though I'm standing in the middle of a garden in full bloom, the sunlight filtering through petals, casting everything in a golden glow. Yet, it's not overwhelming‚Äîthere's a softness that draws me in rather than dazzles me from afar.\n\nAs the fragrance deepens, the heart of tuberose and jasmine reveals itself, and I find it utterly captivating. These white florals dance on my skin, rich yet ethereal, making me feel grounded in my femininity without losing a sense of lightness. It's in this moment that I realize My Way is more than a scent‚Äîit's a reflection of who I am and who I aspire to be, graceful but unafraid, classic but always open to new possibilities.\n\nThe dry-down, with its soft cedarwood, warm vanilla, and white musk, lingers like a beautiful memory I can't quite let go of. It's warm and comforting, but never too heavy, staying with me in the most subtle, intimate way. I love how it feels personal, like it was crafted just for me, yet universal in its appeal.\n\nEven the bottle, with its elegant simplicity, speaks to the spirit of adventure and self-discovery that My Way encapsulates. Every time I pick it up, I'm reminded of the journeys I've taken‚Äîboth literal and figurative‚Äîand those still ahead. In wearing it, I feel as though I'm embracing the world on my own terms, confident in my path, but always open to the beauty around me.\n\nFor me, My Way isn't just a fragrance‚Äîit's a reminder to stay true to myself while welcoming every new experience with grace.",

The fragrance doesn't last long on your body or clothing. The small sticker under the bottle isn't the same as the real MyWay perfume. I admit that I was hesitant because of the price is about $79 less than the real MyWay for the size I purchased. With that said, it goes with the cliche you get what you paid for. On the positive side, shipping was fast and it was well packaged. Walmart, I strongly suggest that you review and revise your policy and screening process for outside sellers who misled, hide or falsely advertise a product.",

This is for my sister who is 29 %26 6 foot tall, extremely lanky and has scoliosis in her back. She's been sleeping on a daybed for a little over six months now and at first she loved it, but eventually, the thinner mattress just wasn't cutting it. We tried buying foam toppers and eventually decided to just buy a mattress we could use without a boxspring to replace it. She has a developmental delay and will be with me as long as we're both kicking. She never really explained how bad the old mattress was hurting her but once I got the bed completely expanded and put on top of her bedframe I kid you not this girl was asleep within 20 minutes of laying down. A girl who usually stays up hours watching old reruns of her favorite TV shows. We got it on a black Friday deal for $70 and I seriously cannot believe the quality even if this bed were only hold up two years. I am beyond satisfied!",

        "text": "I'm rating 3 stars because even after waiting the minimum of 72 hours per the provided instructions, my mattress still didn't inflate to the entire 12 inches. It only inflated to 10 inches. It is now day 7, and the height of the mattress is still at 10 inches (please see pictures). I measured the mattress in all areas. I'm very disappointed, because I feel cheated out of my money. If this was the case, I should've been charged for the less expensive 10-inch mattress instead of the more expensive 12-inch mattress. Other than feeling cheated out of my money, the mattress is a pretty decent mattress for my 10-year-old. I'm unsure of how it sleeps, however, my 10-year-old hasn't complained. Shipping took only a day or 2, which was a pretty good turnaround. The box appeared to have once been glued shut because I noticed glue on the box once I cut the packaging tape to open the box. However, the glue was not in tact. It appeared to have been tampered with. Like the box was opened, and then taped back together to repackage. If that makes any sense. The mattress itself didn't appear to have been tampered with. It was compressed and sealed in the plastic. Overall, I'm disappointed because I didn't get what I paid for. I paid for the 12-inch mattress, but received a 10-inch mattress. Buy at your own risk.",

It does spring up into a firm mattress but not without sinking down first for a second. The whole mattress shakes when one person moves so my wife got woken up a bunch of times. The spring also mean that there is a sensation of being decoupled from the floor so while it is firm is doesn't feel supporting because there some lateral wiggling going on. We tried to like it for weeks but ultimately returned it.",

He has a PS4 but he usually uses the headset when playing online games on his PC. I can't hear his PC and he can't hear me talking to him when he wears them. The mic is fine, too. This headset is a great value for most uses. My son does have a problem with audio bleed when playing YouTube videos in one browser window while playing video games in another browser window while using Discord chat. The others in the chat can her the singing from my son's YouTube videos but they don't hear the music. He has updated software. He tried plugging into different ports. He adjusted the volume on the video, the sound manager and elsewhere. If you are just listening to a video or using video chat or gaming, you should be fine. When you do several of these things at the same time, you may experience audio bleed. The headset is adjustable and comfortable even for my son's big head. The only other issue is that there isn't any website for the manufacturer to find troubleshooting tips. Since my son even wears out the more expensive headsets, we found these are comparable for a more affordable price.",

        "text": "Crazy to think I have been drinking it for almost 10 years now! My work day mornings always consist of a Bing instead of coffee. Recently got my dad hooked as well. \n\nThe flavor is SO tasty, to me it is more like soda vs other energy drinks that taste like chemicals. It gives a noticeably good boost as well. I do also appreciate the smaller can size. Highly recommend !",
