You could easily spend a couple of hours at a time playing Astro's Playroom. I highly recommend buying the PS5 disc edition.",

These holes expose nearby wording which identify the contents as a PlayStation. Luckily, mine was not stolen, but I was also home to receive it. \n\nFurthermore, either my courier thought the holes made great handles or the holes allowed the package to become snagged on something. Either way, not only was the shipping box torn open, but this also completely ripped up the bottom of the PS5 packaging.\n\nI've never made a stink before, no matter how poor the packaging. However, when I spend $550 on a single item, I expect it to arrive protected....or, at the very least, in a box with all its sides. It's just common sense.",

He has only used it one day and when he went to put a disc in to play the disc drive sounded like it was a weedwacker/trimmer that you use outside to work on lawns. It was so loud. My husband and I tried multiple disc and it made that noise every time. After about 10 minutes or so it would stop but after some time it would start back up again. He had a disc in while he downloaded content for it and was playing a digital game and after about an hour playing the digital game the consoles drive started getting really loud again. We didn‚Äôt figured it was cause the disc was still in there downloading content, but all of a sudden the disc came flinging out of the console. I‚Äôm very mad about the fact that I‚Äôm paying over a $1,000 to Walmart for a console that was supposed to be brand new and it doesn‚Äôt even work right before we even get to use it. Now I‚Äôm probably going to have to call Sony and see if they will either fix it or replace it. There‚Äôs no point in having a disc version of a console when the console won‚Äôt even keep your games in it, and 90% of your games are on disc. Very disappointed and honestly don‚Äôt know how I feel about ever buying another console or video game system from Walmart again.",

Very disappointing.",
